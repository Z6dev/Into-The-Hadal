# Into The Hadal
---
Just my Little game of mine about submarines.
Objective: mine stuff and get back up without dying.

## What I may add
1. Enemies and Bosses. Like Giant fishes, monster, or even an enemy submarine!   
2. Upgrade path. Upgrades are neat, whatever.   
3. Terrain Generation, I'm not going to do the map making by hand.
4. Infinite Mode, aka "Blu abissale"
